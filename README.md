## Goal of the Project:
The goal of the project is to design them responsively based on the User Stories provided. A finished project has to be run with the given test cases and should pass. 

### Setup
All of the projects are static websites, so if you are interested. Simply, download the files and run index.html in your browser. I will also put the link of each project created through codepen.
